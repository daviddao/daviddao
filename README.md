### Hi, I'm David 👋


I'm a naturalist and computer scientist. I grew up in Germany's beautiful [Black Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest) as the son of [Hoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoa_people) refugees.

- 🛰 I'm the founder of [GainForest](https://gainforest.app/#/), a decentralized green fund using machine learning to fight deforestation.
- 🔭 I'm also a PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) working on ecological machine learning and ethical data markets.
- 🌱 My goal is to save our planet with crazy technology 🌍
