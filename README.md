### Hi, I'm David <img src="https://media.tenor.com/e3GqicbfhMYAAAAi/get-greeting-get-greetings.gif" width="25px">

I'm an AI researcher, conservationist and science explorer. I grew up in Germany's [Black Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest) as the son of [Hoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoa_people) [boat people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people) refugees. I build systems that tackle climate change and empower local and Indigenous communities through equitable AI. I co-initiated algorithmic data valuation (a key part of data marketplaces) and host a list of awful AI applications.
