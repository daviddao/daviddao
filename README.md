### Hi, I'm David <img src="https://media.tenor.com/e3GqicbfhMYAAAAi/get-greeting-get-greetings.gif" width="25px">

I'm an AI researcher, conservationist and science explorer. I grew up in Germany's [Black Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest) as the son of [Hoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoa_people) [boat people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people) refugees. I build systems that tackle climate change and support local and Indigenous communities through equitable AI. I co-initiated algorithmic data valuation (a key part of data marketplaces) and host a list of awful AI applications. I completed my postdoctoral research in environmental and computer science at ETH Zurich and conducted research at MIT, UC Berkeley, and Stanford. I hold a doctorate in computer science from [ETH Zurich](https://ethambassadors.ethz.ch/2025/01/07/what-connects-ai-albert-einstein-and-roald-dahl-david-dao/) (h-index 15, 1650+ citations).
